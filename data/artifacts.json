Title Tag (H1)\n- **Include primary keyword** within first 60 characters\n- **Make it compelling** — use numbers, power words, or questions\n- **Front-load keywords** when possible\n- ✅ Good: \"7 Event Photo Booth Ideas That Boost Brand Engagement\"\n- ❌ Bad: \"Some Ideas for Your Event That Might Help\"\n\n#### 2. Meta Description\n- **150-160 characters max** (gets truncated after)\n- **Include primary keyword naturally**\n- **Include a call-to-action** (Learn how, Discover, Find out)\n- **Accurately summarize the content**\n\n#### 3. URL Structure\n- **Short and descriptive** (3-5 words ideal)\n- **Include primary keyword**\n- **Use hyphens, not underscores**\n- **All lowercase**\n- ✅ `brandfiltr.com/blog/event-photo-booth-ideas`\n- ❌ `brandfiltr.com/blog/7_Amazing_Ideas_for_Photo_Booths_at_Events_2026`\n\n#### 4. Headings (H2, H3, H4)\n- **Use H2 for main sections**, H3 for subsections\n- **Include secondary keywords** in headings naturally\n- **Make them descriptive** — readers should understand content from headings alone\n- **Use question-based headers** when targeting featured snippets\n\n#### 5. Content Structure\n- **First paragraph hook** — Grab attention immediately\n- **Primary keyword in first 100 words**\n- **Short paragraphs** — 2-4 sentences max\n- **Bullet points and numbered lists** for scanability\n- **Images every 300-500 words** to break up text\n- **Minimum 1,500 words** for pillar content (800+ for standard posts)\n\n#### 6. Internal Linking\n- **Link to 3-5 related internal pages** per post\n- **Use descriptive anchor text** (not \"click here\")\n- **Link to high-priority pages** you want to rank\n- **Create topic clusters** — pillar pages linking to related content\n\n#### 7. External Linking\n- **Link to 2-3 authoritative external sources** per post\n- **Cite statistics and research** with links\n- **Open external links in new tabs**\n- **Avoid linking to competitors** unless comparing\n\n#### 8. Image Optimization\n- **Descriptive file names** (`branded-photo-overlay-example.jpg` not `IMG_4523.jpg`)\n- **Alt text with keywords** (but describe the image accurately)\n- **Compress images** — aim for under 200KB each\n- **Use WebP format** when possible\n\n#### 9. Technical Checklist\n- [ ] Mobile-friendly layout\n- [ ] Page loads under 3 seconds\n- [ ] Schema markup added (Article, FAQ, HowTo when applicable)\n- [ ] Open Graph tags for social sharing\n- [ ] Canonical URL set\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Part 3: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Rules\n\nGEO = Optimizing content for AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Claude.\n\n### Why GEO Matters\n\n- **ChatGPT has 400M+ weekly users** — they're asking questions AI answers\n- **Google AI Overviews appear on 13%+ of all searches** — and growing\n- **AI doesn't rank pages** — it cites authoritative sources\n- **Your content shapes AI responses** — or your competitors' content does\n\n### GEO Content Rules\n\n#### 1. Answer Questions Directly\n- **Lead with the answer** — don't bury it under fluff\n- **Use question-based headers** that match how people ask AI\n- **Provide concise, quotable statements** AI can pull verbatim\n\n#### 2. Structure for AI Consumption\n- **Use clear hierarchical headings** (H1 → H2 → H3)\n- **Short paragraphs** (2-3 sentences ideal for AI parsing)\n- **Bullet points and numbered lists** — AI loves structured data\n- **TL;DR summaries** at the beginning or end\n- **FAQ sections** at the bottom of every post\n\n#### 3. Demonstrate E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust)\n- **Share firsthand experience** — \"In our experience working with 500+ events...\"\n- **Cite specific data and statistics** with sources\n- **Include author bios** with credentials\n- **Add testimonials and case studies**\n- **Update content regularly** (add \"Last updated: [date]\")\n\n#### 4. Build Entity Association\n- **Mention Brand Filtr alongside competitors** in industry context\n- **Associate with relevant topics** (event technology, branded photos, event marketing)\n- **Use consistent terminology** so AI understands what you do\n- **Get mentioned on other sites** — co-citations matter\n\n#### 5. Make Content AI-Crawlable\n- **Use server-side rendering** (SSR) when possible\n- **Ensure clean HTML structure**\n- **Don't hide content behind JavaScript** that bots can't read\n- **Allow AI crawlers** in robots.txt (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, etc.)\n\n#### 6. Optimize for Conversational Queries\nTraditional SEO: \"event photo booth ideas\"\nGEO also targets: \"what kind of photo experience should I have at my corporate event?\"\n\n- **Think in questions, not just keywords**\n- **Target long-tail conversational phrases**\n- **Answer the \"why\" and \"how\" not just \"what\"**\n\n### GEO Content Checklist\n\n- [ ] Does the content directly answer the primary question in the first 2-3 sentences?\n- [ ] Is the structure clear with logical H2/H3 hierarchy?\n- [ ] Are there bullet points or lists AI can easily parse?\n- [ ] Are statistics cited with authoritative sources?\n- [ ] Is there a FAQ section addressing related questions?\n- [ ] Does the content mention Brand Filtr in context of relevant industry terms?\n- [ ] Is author expertise/experience demonstrated?\n- [ ] Is the content updated recently (within 6 months)?\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Part 4: Content Calendar Framework\n\n### Posting Frequency Recommendation\n- **Minimum**: 2 posts per month\n- **Ideal**: 1 post per week\n- **Aggressive**: 2-3 posts per week\n\n### Content Mix (Monthly)\n- **Pillar Content**: 1/month, 2,000-3,000 words — SEO authority, comprehensive guides\n- **Standard Blog**: 2-3/month, 1,000-1,500 words — Keyword targeting, education\n- **News/Trends**: 1-2/month, 600-800 words — Freshness, timeliness\n- **Case Study**: 1/month, 800-1,200 words — Social proof, conversions\n\n### Seasonal Content Ideas\n- **Q1**: New year event planning, trade show season prep\n- **Q2**: Wedding season, outdoor events, conferences\n- **Q3**: Back-to-school events, fall festivals\n- **Q4**: Holiday parties, year-end corporate events, planning for next year\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Part 5: Quick Reference Checklist\n\n### Before Publishing Every Post\n\n**SEO Essentials**\n- [ ] Title includes primary keyword (under 60 characters)\n- [ ] Meta description written (150-160 characters with CTA)\n- [ ] URL is short, lowercase, hyphenated\n- [ ] Primary keyword in first 100 words\n- [ ] 3+ internal links added\n- [ ] 2+ external links to authoritative sources\n- [ ] All images have alt text and are compressed\n- [ ] Mobile preview looks good\n\n**GEO Essentials**\n- [ ] Main question answered in first paragraph\n- [ ] Clear H2/H3 structure\n- [ ] Bullet points or numbered lists included\n- [ ] Statistics cited with sources\n- [ ] FAQ section added (3-5 questions)\n- [ ] Author bio with credentials\n- [ ] \"Last updated\" date visible\n\n**Quality Check**\n- [ ] Proofread for grammar/spelling\n- [ ] Readability score checked (aim for Grade 8 or lower)\n- [ ] No fluff — every sentence adds value\n- [ ] Clear CTA at the end\n- [ ] Related posts linked\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Tools & Resources\n\n### Keyword Research\n- **Ubersuggest** (free tier available)\n- **Google Keyword Planner** (free with Google Ads account)\n- **AnswerThePublic** (question-based queries)\n- **Semrush** (paid, comprehensive)\n\n### SEO Analysis\n- **Google Search Console** (free, essential)\n- **Yoast SEO** or **RankMath** (WordPress plugins)\n- **Screaming Frog** (technical audits)\n\n### GEO Monitoring\n- **Semrush AI Visibility Toolkit** (track brand mentions in AI)\n- **Manual testing** — ask ChatGPT, Perplexity about your topics weekly\n\n### Content Quality\n- **Hemingway Editor** (readability)\n- **Grammarly** (grammar/spelling)\n- **Canva** (images and graphics)\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Success Metrics to Track\n\n- **Organic traffic**: ↑ 10% month-over-month (Weekly)\n- **Keyword rankings (top 10)**: ↑ 5 new keywords/month (Weekly)\n- **Time on page**: > 2 minutes (Monthly)\n- **Bounce rate**: < 60% (Monthly)\n- **Backlinks earned**: ↑ 2-3/month (Monthly)\n- **AI citations (GEO)**: Track brand mentions (Monthly)\n\n---\n\n*This document should be reviewed and updated quarterly as SEO/GEO best practices evolve.*\n\n**Last Updated**: February 2026\n**Next Review**: May 2026",
